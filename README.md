# Awesome Course

Create awesome courses that let your audience learn by coding with you. ⌨️

> Paid your attention? Let me explain it a little bit more: As a developer, when we want to learn a new software technology, especially beginners, we mostly start reading documents of it, good to start, then guess what? Yes, we are trying to find other resources for advanced topics. Aaand we find video courses. Aahhh! Video courses are looots of wasting time. And time is priceless. We need to start coding to learn it, not just watching or reading. Any course created with Awesome Course lets us read the doc on the left and write the code on the right side to test ourselves. Here is what it needs to be.
