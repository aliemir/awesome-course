# Create Your First Lesson

In your repository, you see `/course` folder and content in init. Let's see how does this structure works:

1. For every `lesson-[LESSON_ID]` folder, `/lesson/[LESSON_ID]` route will be created.
2. In a lesson folder, there are chapters. For every `chapter-[ID]` folder, `/lesson[LESSON_ID]/chapter/[CHAPTER_ID]` route will be created.
3. In a chapter folder, you will need to create a `readme.md` file and coding files.
4. Beside these, there are start and completed files. If you put `start.md` and `completed.md` files to `lesson-[LESSON_ID]/`, they will be generated as `/lesson/[LESSON_ID]` and `/lesson/[LESSON_ID]/completed` routes.

### Create a Chapter

Lets start by creating our first chapter. In `/course/lesson-3/chapter-3/` (because 1 and 2 are already created üëâüèΩüëàüèº, of course you can continue by editing them), create `readme.md` file. Here, you can put any markdown content to tell your chapter details.

Also, there are some props that you will need to use.

### Configure Markdown Metadata

Markdown documents have metadata at the top called [Front Matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/).

Awesome Course automatically gets these data to show current chapter title on footer and watch question file for code editor.

Add metadata like below to your top of markdown files:

```md title="course/lesson-3/chapter-3/readme.md" {1-4}
---
title: Write your first test
fileNameToEdit: Button.test.js
---

# Chapter 3: Functions

Rest of your markdown...
```

If you editing `start.md` or `completed.md` files, you will need to provide a `description` also:

```md title="course/lesson-3/chapter-3/readme.md" {1-4}
---
title: Welcome to Awesome Course!
description: Here you will be able to learn this great new technology by coding!
---

In this lesson...
```
