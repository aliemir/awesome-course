# Awesome Course

Create awesome courses that let your audience learn by coding.

### Why?

> As a developer, to learn a new software technology, we mostly start reading a document about it. Good to start. Then we are trying to find other resources for advanced topics and watch video courses. Video courses might be wasting time. To learn something, we need to get our hands dirty; code. **Awesome Course lets you learn any course by coding directly.**

> As a content creator, making video courses is exhausting. Filming, editing, camera, microphone, all the details are important to be good at that. Do you really care that your audience learns from your content? **Awesome Course let you create courses that your audience learn by coding.**
